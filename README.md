# Introduction:
    My objective is to create a Capstone project that will give awareness to people about Tuberculosis. 

# Goals:
    Ending the global TB epidemic,reducing TB incidence and mortality.

#  The end result of this project will aware people about:
    - The symptoms of disease
    - The Screening process for disease
    - Types of Tuberculosis
    - How it spread 
    - Risk factors
    - Prevention
    - Treatments
    - Tuberculosis detection rate
    - Success rate

# Technical Insight:
    - Requirements.txt- Conatains data to use virtual environments.
    - Matplotlib - Graphical representation of data.
    - Tableau - graphical presentation of combined files.
    - README.md: general information about the project.
    - Data/raw : raw data files.
    - Data/clean: cleaned data files.
    - Src :  jupyter notebooks and python scripts

# Steps:

1. List(or research) key metrics for Tuberculosis.
2. Identify the type of analysis that can be done and list the questions that can be answered.
3. Review available data and create  and save the raw data in raw folder.
4. Clean the data by removing unneeded columns and rows also rename the column name if needed then create  and save the clean data in the clean folder.
6. Analyze the data and answer the question.
7. Visualize the analysis.

# Getting Started

- Create the project repository and clone it.
- Add details to the readme file that has project details then commit and push it.
-  Create a virtual environment and install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Open the `src/01_discover.ipynb` file to view the raw data.

# Capstone Project Criteria
1. This README file provides information about the project and how to use the code.
2. `data/README.md` provides data dictionary for the data used in the project.
3. `src/01_discover.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook using pandas to understand the raw data files.

# Running the Program:

The following is a guide to running the project files locally:

1. Fork the repository repo link.

2. Clone the repository to your Github account.

3. Access the repository from your command line or preferred CMD software.

4. Install a virtual environment. The command in Gitbash is python -m venv venv.

5. Activate the virtual environment. The command in Gitbash is source venv/scripts/activate.

6. Install the requirements.txt file to install necessary packages by running pip install requirements.txt.
